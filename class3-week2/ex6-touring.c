/*
LBS290 Exercise 17 - A Touring Machine.
This is a subset of an important concept in Computer Science
called a Turing Machine.
We call it a "Touring Machine" because it
"wanders around and does things in memory"
similar to a Turing Machine.
Your computer has 256 characters of memory.
The machine keeps track of the "position" or the "head"
where data is to be written. The starting position is zero.
You are to read a sequence of instructions from input and perform those instructions.
When there are no more instructions,
print the memory out as a zero-terminated C character array. Here are the instructions you need to support:
*/

/*
42     Store this value into the memory at the current position
>      Move the "position" one to the right (i.e. position++);
<      Move the "position" one to the left (i.e. position--);
*/

/*
All of the numbers should be in the range of 0-255 so they fit into a C char variable.
Fun Fact: Dr. Chuck did not assign this question in 1991. But if time travel were possible, he would consider adding it to LBS 290.
