/*
K&R Exercise 3-6.

Write a program which copies its input to its output,
except that it prints only one instance from each group of adjacent identical lines.
(This is a simple version of the UNIX utility uniq.)

You can use the strcpy(dest, src) from the string.h to
copy one string (character array) to another.
You can also use strcmp(s1,s2) to compare two strings (character arrays).
strcmp() returns zero if the strings are equal.

      strcpy(keep, line);
      printf("%s\n", keep);
